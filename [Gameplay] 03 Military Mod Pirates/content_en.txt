Military Mod

Designed for players who want to have a challenge while building up - or players that want to focus on seafight part of the game.
This Mod is seperated into 3 different parts, so you can choose what you actually want.

**** Important ****
Part 1 has to be active, in order to use part 2 or part 3 or both.
Also dont rename folders. (if you do keep the order of parts 1 to 3)

**** Mod Compabilities ****
This mod is not compatible to the old "new ships" mod. You also should remove Battleship and IrconClad Mods (ships are added within this mod).

****************************** PART 3 (THIS MOD) (REQUIRES PART 1) *********************************************

This buffs both Pirates to a very military heavy and challening AI. Pirates will have larger fleets, use more modern-tech ships
and some stronger ships. They will also built ships way faster and will get a unique super-heavy ship that can compete with
larger fleets.

Pirates diplomacy was not changed but made it harder to have permanent peace. Also harbor defenses stay mostly the same as before.

If you however manage to remove a pirate, he will be faster back and come with a large armada to reign the world again.

Recommended setting for pirates is "Normal". if you put it to "Hard" you will really struggle in early game to get off you island.
Especially if you use all three parts of the mod, the improved AI and the pirate will be become very hard to handle in most
stages of the game.

This part also adds another new ships to the game, both pirate based.
