Military Mod

Designed for players who want to have a challenge while building up - or players that want to focus on seafight part of the game.
This Mod is seperated into 3 different parts, so you can choose what you actually want.

**** Important ****
Part 1 has to be active, in order to use part 2 or part 3 or both.
Also dont rename folders. (if you do keep the order of parts 1 to 3)

**** Mod Compabilities ****
This mod is not compatible to the old "new ships" mod. You also should remove Battleship and IrconClad Mods (ships are added within this mod).

****************************** PART 2 (THIS MOD) (REQUIRES PART 1) *********************************************

This buffs Bente, Willie and the Princess from 1 star to 4 star AIs. They will build up faster to investor levels,
make a lot of more ships (also new ships) and they will have their harbor defenses upgraded. Defenses in the old world
will be buffed even more. Also some diplomacy changes to make them compatible with others AIs.

Those three AIs shall be a real challange all over the game and will be even very hard to remove in the endgame, despite
you having huge fleets with items. Especially Bente is designed to have a real endgame rentless opponent, if u let her build.

Princess Qing will be the most balanced AI over the buffed ones.

Willie Wibblesock will focus the most on military, attacks and defenses.

Bente Jorgenson will be the toughest one - she will build the strongest defenses, will build up slightly faster than
      both others and will get a special ship type, only available to her, that can cause serious trouble.

The Mod also gives Admiral Silva a slight improve on old world defense and buffs the Anarchist Hugo Mercier to a 
regual 3 star AI (his diplomacy and diplomacy based actions are not affected and will stay as usual).

You can try, but i would not recommed using all three 4* AIs in one game - you will regret it.

Keep in mind that you might want to change some settings like influence or income to an easier level in order to compete with
the new AIs.
